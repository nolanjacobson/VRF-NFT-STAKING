# SCE-Take-Home

The goal of this exercise is to design and implement a SP NFT (ERC-721) with different 
metadata revealing approaches. The solution should leverage Chainlink for random 
number generation and allow for two distinct revealing approaches, with the potential to 
support future approaches.

## Overview

Provide an overview of the project, its purpose, and functionality.

## Contracts

### SPNFT.sol

- **Purpose**: Describe what `SPNFT.sol` does (e.g., ERC721 NFT contract for...).
- **Key Features**: Outline the main features of this contract (e.g., NFT minting, metadata handling).
- **Interactions**: Explain how this contract interacts with others, if applicable.

### PostRevealNFT.sol

- **Purpose**: Describe the purpose of `PostRevealNFT.sol`.
- **Functionality**: Explain its key functionalities (e.g., handling NFTs after reveal).
- **Interactions**: Note any important interactions with other contracts.

### SPNFTStaking.sol

- **Purpose**: Describe the staking functionality provided by `SPNFTStaking.sol`.
- **Staking Mechanism**: Detail how users can stake their NFTs and earn rewards.
- **Reward Calculation**: Explain the reward calculation mechanism.

### RewardTokenERC20.sol

- **Purpose**: Explain the role of `RewardTokenERC20.sol` (e.g., ERC20 token for staking rewards).
- **Tokenomics**: Describe the tokenomics, including minting and distribution.
- **Usage**: Explain how this token is used within the ecosystem (e.g., rewards for staking).

## Setup and Deployment
